            My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/pierregillesl">Pierre-Gilles Leymarie</a> and I founded Gladys 6
            years ago! <br /><br />

            My initial goal was to build my own jarvis for my student appartment. I open-sourced it, and it became a
            well-known home automation software used by thousands of users.
            <br />
            <br />
            Today, you're more than 40 000 having downloaded Gladys, so I decided to work
            on Gladys as my main job. This is thanks to your support that I can continue my work on it!
            Thanks for supporting the project 🙂

              Of course! Gladys is an open-source project, not a creepy organization 😄 If you want to unsubscribe, you
              can do it in one click from the Gladys Gateway. If only all subscriptions were like that...

          <div class="faq">
            <h3>Can you explain how end-to-end encryption works here?</h3>
            <p>
              I took a lot of time to read about state of the art End-To-End Encryption. I read <a
                href="https://www.apple.com/business/site/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf">Apple Security White Paper</a>
              about iMessage E2E encryption feature. I read <a
                href="https://www.dashlane.com/download/Dashlane_SecurityWhitePaper_October2018.pdf">Dashlane</a> White
              paper, read and talked with <a href="https://support.insomnia.rest/article/57-encryption">Insomnia</a>
              Founder, and read about
              ProtonMail implementation of the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">Remote Secure Password</a>
              protocol. <br /><br />

              The Gladys Gateway encrypts all your messages using AES-GCM 256bits algorithm and a unique key generated
              at each message. This key is then encrypted using RSA-OAEP 2048bits algorithm and the public key of your
              Gladys instance.
              Finally, the message is signed with the ECDSA P-256 Algorithm and bundled with an expiry date to avoid <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack">Replay Attack</a>.
              On Gladys side, the user have to validate each new user public key to avoid <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man In The Middle attack</a>.
              With those securities, even if the Gladys Gateway is compromised, the attacker cannot control your Gladys
              instance because he doesn't have your private key.

        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <div class="faq">
            <h3>Why is Gladys Plus not free?</h3>
            <p>
              Gladys and all its services, the Gladys Gateway, the website: everything is 100% open-source and free to
              use.<br />
              But open-source doesn't mean that I don't have any recurring costs on my side: servers, domains,
              community, email services, subscriptions, hardwares... Without counting my time on the project now that
              Gladys is my main activity.
              <br /><br />
              This project respects your privacy, and therefore can live only from theses contributions. Each
              subscription helps me make the project even better, and prove the world that a privacy-first and
              open-source alternative is possible! 🚀
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq">
            <h3>Are you developing more features for Gladys and the Gateway?</h3>
            <p>
              Of course! The more contributors there are on this package, the more I'm able to invest on Gladys. For
              example, last month I paid a professional designer to work on the brand identity of Gladys. We all agree
              that the work he did is incredible,
              and it's only thanks to contributions that I was able to pay this designer. <br /> <br />

              In fact, Gladys it's a little bit like a decentralized company, where the boss, it's you! Thanks to this
              business model, all decisions are made in order to favorize users, not investor or advertisers.
