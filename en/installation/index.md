# Installing Gladys

Gladys is a small server written in Node.js. It's built to run on Linux, Windows or Mac. But I recommend running Gladys on a Raspberry Pi.

#### Why a Raspberry Pi ?

The Raspberry Pi is a small computer, which works amazingly for home control, it is :

- Affordable (35\$)
- Quiet (no fan)
- Low power consumption
- Powerful (Quad-core, up to 4 Go of RAM)
- All connectivities are built-in (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1 LE, Ethernet, 40 GPIO pins, 4 ports USB, Full HDMI port)

If you don't have one, I recommend buying a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TD42S27/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pierre-gilles-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07TD42S27&linkId=66f8c05cd0b5c077e91a759ce0398b63).

You need to buy a fast micro-SD card, like a [SanDisk 32 Gb Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073JWXGNT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pierre-gilles-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B073JWXGNT&linkId=81395c8e333d4c6944d5a62a2db692b1).

Finally, don't forget to buy a [Raspberry Pi 4 power adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TYQRXTK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pierre-gilles-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07TYQRXTK&linkId=367c7478b90ed14204b7e58beb4d926a).
