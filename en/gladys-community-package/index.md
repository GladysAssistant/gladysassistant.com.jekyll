Hey everyone! 

👋 My name is [Pierre-Gilles Leymarie](https://twitter.com/pierregillesl). I'm 24 years old, and since 5 years, I'm building an open-source Home Automation software, Gladys, for completely free on GitHub!

⭐️ My dream is to enable anyone to have his own Jarvis at home, like in Iron Man, without having to install a closed and cloud based solution.

🚀 My long term goal for Gladys, is that it becomes one of the most used open-source platform in Home Automation.

To achieve this goal, I need YOU!

Before summer 2018, I was working as Lead Back-End Engineer in a YC startup. 

My dream was to work on open-source more seriously, and to make Gladys my main activity.

So in August 2018, I left my job and started working full-time on Gladys.

During 3 months, I worked really hard to built a new product: the Gladys Gateway.

I noticed there was a main problem with Gladys: It's easy to access your Raspberry Pi installation when you are at home, but when you are outside it's hard to make Gladys publicly accessible without having security issues: bot trying to hack your Raspberry Pi, that kind of creepy stuff.

So I thought about it, and decided to build the Gladys Gateway: The first End-To-End Encrypted Gateway for Home Automation. It's a web base UI accessible at [gateway.gladysproject.com](https://gateway.gladysproject.com/login) that allows you to control your Gladys instance from anywhere in the world, without having to open your local network to the public, so your Raspberry Pi stays safe.

The main feature of this Gateway is that all communications between your Gladys and the web UI are end-to-end encrypted. 

And today, I'm happy that the Gladys Gateway is now **LIVE** 🚀

I decided to create a Package, the **Gladys Community Package**, that allows you to:

🌎 Access the Gladys Gateway for you and your family/friends

💬 Access our Private Slack so you can exchange with the community

🎁 Receive Gladys stickers in you are in the first 100 subscribers!

💪 Support this open-source projet, help me cover the costs, and help me live from my project!

This package is **available at 9.99€/month**, and you can cancel at anytime of course!

Thanks for all who already pre-ordered the package, your support helped me develop this Gateway during 3 months, and it only happened thanks to your support 🙏

See you soon on Gladys community!
